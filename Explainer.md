# üßæ BalancerLiquidity Smart Contract

## Overview

The `BalancerLiquidity` smart contract provides a lightweight interface to interact with the [Balancer](https://balancer.fi) **RETH/WETH liquidity pool**. It allows users to:

- **Join** the pool by depositing `RETH`, `WETH`, or both.
- **Exit** the pool by redeeming Balancer Pool Tokens (BPT) for `RETH`.

The contract is designed for composability, simplicity, and trustless use with no admin roles or upgrade mechanisms.

---

## Dependencies

```solidity
import { IERC20 } from "../interface/IERC20.sol";
import { IRETH } from "../interface/rocket-pool/IRETH.sol";
import { IVault } from "../interface/IVault.sol";
import {
  WETH, RETH, BALANCER_VAULT,
  BALANCER_POOL_RETH_WETH, BALANCER_POOL_ID_RETH_WETH
} from "./Constants.sol";
```

**Key Imports:**

- `IERC20`: Standard ERC-20 interface
- `IRETH`: Rocket Pool's RETH token interface
- `IVault`: Balancer Vault interface
- `Constants`: Immutable addresses used for tokens and pools

---

## Core Functions

### `join(uint256 rethAmount, uint256 wethAmount)`

- Accepts RETH and/or WETH from the caller
- Approves the Balancer Vault
- Calls `_join()` with prepared data
- Returns any leftover tokens to the sender

### `exit(uint256 bptAmount, uint256 minRethAmountOut)`

- Accepts BPT from the caller
- Calls `_exit()` to redeem liquidity
- Sends **only RETH** back to the user

---

## Internal Mechanics

### `_join(address recipient, address[] memory assets, uint256[] memory maxAmountsIn)`

- Calls `IVault.joinPool()` using `EXACT_TOKENS_IN_FOR_BPT_OUT`
- Adds liquidity to the Balancer pool
- Mints BPT to the recipient

### `_exit(uint256 bptAmount, address recipient, address[] memory assets, uint256[] memory minAmountsOut)`

- Calls `IVault.exitPool()` using `EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_ONE_TOKEN_OUT`
- Removes liquidity from the pool
- Redeems only RETH to the recipient

---

## User Flow

### Joining the Pool

1. User calls `join()` with RETH and/or WETH.
2. Contract transfers and approves tokens to the Vault.
3. Liquidity is added and BPT is minted.
4. Any unused tokens are refunded.

### Exiting the Pool

1. User calls `exit()` with the amount of BPT to redeem.
2. Contract transfers BPT to the Vault.
3. RETH is redeemed and sent to the user.

---

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ **Minimal token approvals** (per call)
- ‚úÖ **Token refund** for unused balances
- ‚úÖ **Slippage protection** using `minAmountsOut`
- ‚úÖ **Token ordering enforced** (RETH before WETH)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No reentrancy guard** (assumes safe Balancer Vault)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Open access model**, no admin control

---

## Design Philosophy

- ‚ùå No upgradeability
- ‚ùå No owner/admin privileges
- ‚úÖ Fully trustless
- ‚úÖ Suitable for integration into DeFi strategies
- ‚úÖ Minimal logic for composability

## üìà Recommended Improvements

The current implementation is minimal by design. However, the following enhancements are recommended to improve safety, flexibility, and interoperability.

---

### 1. `nonReentrant` Modifier

**Purpose:**  
Protect against potential reentrancy via token callbacks or future changes.

**Suggestion:**  
Use OpenZeppelin‚Äôs `ReentrancyGuard` on `join()` and `exit()`.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract BalancerLiquidity is ReentrancyGuard {
    function join(...) external nonReentrant { ... }
    function exit(...) external nonReentrant { ... }
}
```

---

### 2. Configurable Token Withdrawal on Exit

**Current:**  
Only RETH is returned on `exit()`.

**Improvement:**  
Allow users to specify:
- Desired token index (0 for RETH, 1 for WETH), or
- Use `EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_TOKENS_OUT` to receive both tokens proportionally.

---

### 3. Generalized Join/Exit Modes

**Current:**  
Hardcoded join/exit strategies.

**Improvement:**  
Expose `JoinKind`, `ExitKind`, and `userData` to enable:
- Proportional joins
- More efficient exits
- DEX aggregator integrations

---

### 4. Emit Events

**Current:**  
No on-chain events for off-chain tracking.

**Improvement:**  
Emit `Joined` and `Exited` events for better UX and indexing.

```solidity
event Joined(address indexed user, uint256 rethIn, uint256 wethIn, uint256 bptOut);
event Exited(address indexed user, uint256 bptIn, uint256 rethOut, uint256 wethOut);
```

---

### 5. Emergency Token Recovery

**Problem:**  
No way to recover mistakenly sent tokens.

**Improvement:**  
Implement a `sweep()` function restricted to a trusted role or DAO.

> üõ°Ô∏è Only allow non-core tokens (not RETH/WETH/BPT) to be swept.

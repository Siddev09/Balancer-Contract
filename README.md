# ðŸ§¾ BalancerLiquidity Smart Contract

## Overview

The `BalancerLiquidity` smart contract provides a lightweight interface to interact with the [Balancer](https://balancer.fi) **RETH/WETH liquidity pool**. It allows users to:

- **Join** the pool by depositing `RETH`, `WETH`, or both.
- **Exit** the pool by redeeming Balancer Pool Tokens (BPT) for `RETH`.

The contract is designed for composability, simplicity, and trustless use with no admin roles or upgrade mechanisms.

---

## Dependencies

```solidity
import { IERC20 } from "../interface/IERC20.sol";
import { IRETH } from "../interface/rocket-pool/IRETH.sol";
import { IVault } from "../interface/IVault.sol";
import {
  WETH, RETH, BALANCER_VAULT,
  BALANCER_POOL_RETH_WETH, BALANCER_POOL_ID_RETH_WETH
} from "./Constants.sol";
```

## User Flow

### Joining the Pool

1. User calls `join()` with RETH and/or WETH.
2. Contract transfers and approves tokens to the Vault.
3. Liquidity is added and BPT is minted.
4. Any unused tokens are refunded.

### Exiting the Pool

1. User calls `exit()` with the amount of BPT to redeem.
2. Contract transfers BPT to the Vault.
3. RETH is redeemed and sent to the user.

**Key Imports:**

- `IERC20`: Standard ERC-20 interface
- `IRETH`: Rocket Pool's RETH token interface
- `IVault`: Balancer Vault interface
- `Constants`: Immutable addresses used for tokens and pools

---



## Security Considerations

- **Minimal token approvals** (per call)
- **Token refund** for unused balances
- **Slippage protection** using `minAmountsOut`
- **Token ordering enforced** (RETH before WETH)

---

## Recommended Improvements

The current implementation is minimal by design. However, the following enhancements are recommended to improve safety, flexibility, and interoperability.

---

### 1. `nonReentrant` Modifier

**Purpose:**  
Protect against potential reentrancy via token callbacks or future changes.

**Suggestion:**  
Use OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard` on `join()` and `exit()`.

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract BalancerLiquidity is ReentrancyGuard {
    function join(...) external nonReentrant { ... }
    function exit(...) external nonReentrant { ... }
}
```

---

### 2. Configurable Token Withdrawal on Exit

**Current:**  
Only RETH is returned on `exit()`.

**Improvement:**  
Allow users to specify:
- Desired token index (0 for RETH, 1 for WETH), or
- Use `EXACT_BPT_IN_FOR_TOKENS_OUT` to receive both tokens proportionally.

---

### 3. Generalized Join/Exit Modes

**Current:**  
Hardcoded join/exit strategies.

**Improvement:**  
Expose `JoinKind`, `ExitKind`, and `userData` to enable:
- Proportional joins
- More efficient exits
- DEX aggregator integrations

---

### 4. Emit Events

**Current:**  
No on-chain events for off-chain tracking.

**Improvement:**  
Emit `Joined` and `Exited` events for better UX and indexing.

```solidity
event Joined(address indexed user, uint256 rethIn, uint256 wethIn, uint256 bptOut);
event Exited(address indexed user, uint256 bptIn, uint256 rethOut, uint256 wethOut);
```

---

### 5. Emergency Token Recovery

**Problem:**  
No way to recover mistakenly sent tokens.

**Improvement:**  
Implement a `sweep()` function restricted to a trusted role or DAO.

> Only allow non-core tokens (not RETH/WETH/BPT) to be swept.
